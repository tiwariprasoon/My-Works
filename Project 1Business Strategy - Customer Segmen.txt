Business Strategy - Customer Segmentation
Project 1
Description

Problem Statement: Customer segmentation is an important technique for developing marketing strategies. It helps in better targeting and positioning customers with the company's offerings. We can perform customer personality analysis by observing their demographics and preferences.

A detailed analysis of a company's preferred customers is known as a customer personality analysis. It enables a company to better understand its customers and makes it easier to modify products or services to meet the specific needs, behaviors, and demands of several types of customers.

Instead of spending money marketing a new product to every customer in a company's database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only to that specific segment.

 

Objective:

Perform customer segmentation to better understand customer personality types

Steps to perform:

Import the input file. Check if the variable with date values has been imported appropriately
Find the variables with missing values. If the proportion of missing values is less than 5%, then delete the rows
Calculate the newest and oldest customer's enrolment date in the records
Create a feature "Customer_For" of the number of days the customers started to shop in the store relative to the last recorded date
Find the "Age" of customers by the "Year_Birth" indicating the birth year
Create a feature "Spent" indicating the total amount spent by the customer in various categories over two years
Create another feature "Living_With" out of "Marital_Status" to extract the living situation of couples. Consider a value ‘Partner’ for the variable "Living_With" for the instances where "Marital_Status" is either “Married” or “Together”. Rest all can be taken as ‘Alone’
Create a feature "Children" to indicate the total number of children in a household that is, kids and teenagers
To get further clarity on a household, create a feature indicating "Family_Size"
Create a feature "Is_Parent" to indicate the parenthood status
Keep only two categories in the field – ‘Education’ – Undergraduate, Graduate
For clarity, change the name of the variables as:
 

MntWines	Wines
MntFruits	Fruits
MntMeatProducts	MeatProducts
MntFishProducts	FishProducts
MntSweetProducts	SweetsProducts
MntGoldProds	GoldProds
 

  13. Drop the redundant columns: "Marital_Status", "Dt_Customer", "Z_CostContact", "Z_Revenue", "Year_Birth", and "ID"

  14. Create box plots and histograms for age and income. Identify the outliers and delete rows with outliers

  15. Find out the correlation between variables. Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation plot

  16. Now you should prepare the data for cluster analysis and Categorical variables must be incorporated in clustering. Perform necessary encoding techniques to transform the categorical variables

  17. Find the appropriate number of clusters using the elbow method

  18. Perform cluster analysis using k-means

  19. After a cluster analysis is performed, it is important for the business to define the clusters. Perform cluster profiling, describe each cluster in detail, and use appropriate visualizations to support your views
